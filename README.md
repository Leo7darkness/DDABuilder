Character Builder for Digimon Digital Adventures Tabletop System

This is a static, non-web HTML5 webpage for the creation and maintenance of character profiles (Human and Digimon) in the Digimon Digital Adventures Tabletop System.

You can find the builder here: https://taurusversant.github.io/DDABuilder
This builder does not remember data, so to preserve you must use the save and load buttons to archive characters as json files locally

More can be learned about the system here: http://digimon-digital-adventures.tumblr.com/handbooks
